# Challenge 3 - Opening the gates of the SHM

A 12-wheeled vehicle kicks up a haze of gunpowder-grey dust as it makes tracks across undulating terrain. After hours of driving, you arrive safely at the Artemis Base Camp. 

Open the gates of the Surface Habitat Module (SHM) according to the instructions in the DOCX file in this folder.

Find out and fill in the missing words, then compile a string from the initial character of each word to use as a passcode for the next challenge.
