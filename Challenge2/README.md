# Challenge 2 - Entering the Moon coordinates

Due to the communication failure during the failed landing, your mission control provided the coordinates of the Artemis base camp in a strange format. Decipher the string in the DOCX file in this folder to obtain the Moon coordinates of the Artemis Base Camp.

Enter the original coordinates (without spaces) as a passcode to open the next file of the challenge.
