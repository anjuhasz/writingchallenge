# Storyline

In 2078, a recent but failed private mining mission to the Moon got you stranded on the surface of our celestial companion. Your moon descent/ascent unit (MDAU) was damaged to the extent that you are unable to use it to leave the surface or use its life supplies.

A rescue mission is on its way from Earth, but it takes four weeks for them to land.

Your only chance for survival is to reach the abandoned Artemis Base Camp station - built in the early 2030s as part of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program but vacated in the late 2040s - and enter it for shelter and life support.

Your Ground Mission Control has managed to find the original instructions for the Artemis Base Camp, but they are in an old, compressed, and hardly convertible format. Conversion has resulted in damaged and hardly readable text. 

The challenge comprises the following types of tasks :

* Re-assemble/re-order the scattered parts
* Guess and write the missing parts (parts of words, full words, etc.)
* Put the instructions in the right order.

Pieces of input will be available in a dedicated GitHub repository in password-protected files. As parts of the tasks, some codes/strings need to be deciphered so that they can be entered as passwords.

The mission comprises the following challenges:

1. Make your lunar rover operational according to the correct procedure.
2. Reach the Artemis Base Camp at the lunar south pole around the Shackleton Crater (89.9°S 0.0°E).
   Your task is to enter the right Moon coordinates into your rover's computer.
3. Open the gates of the Surface Habitat Module with the right code.
4. Re-pressurize the airlock vacuum chamber according to the right procedure. Re-assemble the scattered instructions.
5. Re-initialize the infrastructure operating systems of the Surface Habitat Module of the base camp.
6. Find and assemble the operating instructions for the food storage and processing equipment.
7. Find and re-assemble the troubleshooting  instructions for the food storage and processing equipment.
